1. Purpose

Computes the Newman-Penrose scalar Psi4 from the ADMBase and ScalarBase variables,
by using the formalism described in Appendix C of arXiv:gr-qc/0606079. 
Specifically, we extend the thorn NPScalars by adding source terms 
for a complex scalar field, with real part \Phi and imaginary part \Phi^*, 
and conjugated momenta with real part \Pi and imaginary part \Pi^*.

These source terms are:

j_i  = 2 ( \Pi D_i\Phi + \Pi^* D_i\Phi^*  )
S_ij = D_i\Phi D_j\Phi + D_i\Phi^* D_j\Phi^* + (additional terms)

Notice that, when computing S_ij inside the electric part of the Weyl tensor, 
we take advantage of the fact that the (additional terms) part of the expression 
is proportional to the spatial metric and it will be erased when computing 
the tracefree part of Eij, which needs to be traceless by construction. 
Therefore, in the code we only implement the part of S_ij which will contribute
 to the final tracefree expression of Eij.
