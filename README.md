## Purpose

This repository provides the tools simulate black hole spacetimes in the Einstein--Klein-Gordon system,
as first introduced in 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0551,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1548
and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06118.pdf

The Canuda_Scalar arrangement has been
extended to fully relativistic black hole binary spacetimes in
[upcoming; see working notes for details]
