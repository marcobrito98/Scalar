## Purpose

This repository provides the tools to evolve a complex scalar field with nonlinear potential in arbitrary background as first described in <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06118.pdf>. The arrangement also provides the possibility to setup suitable initial data for massive complex scalar fields coupled to binary black holes in full backreaction. Additionally, it is possible to add an external periodic forcing to the right-hand side of the Klein-Gordon equation for studies of parametric resonances.
