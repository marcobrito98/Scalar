Purpose of the thorn:

evolves an Einstein + (complex) scalar system. this thorn merely takes care of
setting the scalar field stress-energy tensor and evolving (with MoL) the scalar
field itself. the evolution of the metric sector needs to be done
elsewhere. conventions used here are as in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.2757.pdf
and as follows:

  G_{\mu \nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}

where

  T_{\mu \nu} = \bar \Phi_{,\mu} \Phi_{,\nu} + \Phi_{,\mu} \bar \Phi_{,\nu}
                - g_{\mu \nu} [  \bar \Phi^{,\sigma} \Phi_{,\sigma}
                               + \mu^2 \bar \Phi \Phi ]

and the phi1 and phi2 used in the code are the real and imaginary part of the
complex field \Phi = (phi1, phi2).

the 3+1 decomposition of the scalar field is done by introducing the 'conjugate
momentum' defined as

  K_\Phi = -1/2 \Lie_n \Phi
         = -1/(2 \alpha) [ \partial_t - \Lie_\beta ] \Phi
