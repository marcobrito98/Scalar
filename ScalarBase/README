1. Purpose

This repository provides the tools to evolve a complex scalar field with
nonlinear potential in arbitrary background as first described in
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06118.pdf>. Additionally, it is possible to add an
external periodic forcing to the right-hand side of the Klein-Gordon equation
for studies of parametric resonances.
