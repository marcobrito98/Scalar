1. Purpose

Create initial data for two black holes coupled to a massive, minimally-coupled, complex scalar field using a single-domain spectral method in the punctures approach. The method is described in arXiv:gr-qc/0404056.

This thorn is an extension of the original TwoPunctures thorn to include scalar field source terms in the Hamiltonian constraint. The initial data can be solved for by choosing the momentum \Kphi of the scalar field to be 0 at the initial time, reducing the momentum constraint to the vacuum case, leaving only the Hamiltonian constraint equation to solve for. 

We include the scalar field contributions to the Hamiltonian constraint by
conformally rescaling the scalar field as \Phi = \psi^\delta \bar\Phi,
where \psi is the conformal factor and \delta < -3 is an exponent that can be chosen at runtime. The conformal rescaling is necessary to ensure that the linearized Hamiltonian constraint equation is well-posed as an elliptic problem.
