1. Purpose

Create initial data for two puncture black holes coupled to a scalar field,
using a single domain spectral method. The method is described in arXiv:gr-qc/0404056.

This thorn is an extension of the original TwoPunctures code to include scalar field related source terms
when solving for the Hamiltonian constraint only. The latter can be done by choosing \Kphi = 0
at the initial time, therefore the momentum constraint reduces to the one in vacuum. 
We include the additional terms in the Hamiltonian constraint by
conformally rescale the scalar field as \Phi = \psi^\delta \bar\Phi,
where \psi is the conformal factor and \delta is an exponent that can be chosen at runtime.
